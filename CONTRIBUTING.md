## Always test your changes.
Do not submit something without at least running the game to see if it compiles.
If you are submitting a new block, make sure it has a translated name, and that it works correctly in-game. If you are changing existing block mechanics, test them out first.

### Translating tips
To begin you'll need to create a translation json  
Translation codes (can be found at your minecraft folder \assets\minecraft\lang) or [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Language)     
example file: en_us.json

- You can freely translate the mod and commit it directly to GitHub or DM me in discord (@iri_dark)
  and send the translation file directly to me
- `\n` means "new line". If you want to split text into multiple lines, use `\n` to do it. (Useful for translating lexicon)
- Don't translate the mod name, it's not that necessarily.  
  Example for the correct one: "Valoria - Blocks" - "Valoria - Блоки"
- Translations aren't 100% accurate, so you can edit them to fix the mistakes
- Lang files are updating automatically
